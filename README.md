# Maka Snake Game

This repository includes a simple Snake game that you can play in your terminal.

## How to run

Use Python 3 to start the game:

```bash
python3 snake.py
```

Use the arrow keys to control the snake. Try to eat as much food (`*`) as possible without hitting the walls or your own tail.
